SecureWise
==========

WISE is Web-based Interactive Survey Environment. 
As the name suggests WISE is used to conduct scheduled online surveys. 
WISE can be broadly categorized into the following modules:

  Admin Module - used for creating new surveys and managing surveys.
  
  Surveyor Module - used by people (invitees) to take up actual survey.

  The Admin Module is used to set-up the surveys, add people (invitees) and invite them to respond to the created survey using emails. Each email contains a link specific to a particular invitee, which can be used to access corresponding surveys.
